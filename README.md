# A Weather App. Dead simple.

## Desktop AND Mobile!

Created with **create-react app**, built with **webpack**

The name of the app speaks for itself, mates!

Type a city in, click search or hit Enter...

Profit! =)

Tech learned and used:
+ React Hooks
+ axios
+ pagination
+ etc...

I'm in the process of refactoring so keep your eyes peeled for updates!


You can play with the app here: https://cra-weather.herokuapp.com/

or get it running locally by cloning the repo and using the basic create-react-app script:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
